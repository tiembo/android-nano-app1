stage 2 cleanups / tweaks
- check TODOs!
- remove static album image size
- handle null album image url
- comments and test for StringHelper
- fade music in and out
- extract out artist name helper (instead of get(0) nonsense), or just pass as intent extra
- bundle DRY in MainActivity and ArtistTracksActivity
- DRY Fragment Callbacks

stage 2 tracks tests
- After activity and fragment finish loading, press back button. Should not crash.
- Press back button while track is playing - track should stop playing
- Press play - should start playing
- Press pause while track is playing - should pause
- Press play again after track is paused - should resume playing from previous location
- After track finishes playing, pressing play should start track from beginning
- After track finishes playing, play button should show a play icon
- Track should be able to be shared
- Press next or previous, then share - correct track should be shared
- (TBD) Next / previous doesn't break with single track

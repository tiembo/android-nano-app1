fixes
! pressing back out of play view seems to cancel service?
! rotate/resume removes part of UI when playing- flip when empty startup fails on both tablet and phone
- share intent shows for tablet layout
. navigate back from sharing - play/pause button icon out of sync if track finished playing
. search for known artist, then search for error artist (check if tablet only?)
. play/pause button state kept when going to prev / next track
. 00:00 shows when selecting different track while current one is playing

stage 2 exceeds
- settings
  - country code
  - ongoing

stage 2 cleanups / tweaks
- check TODOs!
- remove static album image size
- handle null album image url
- comments and test for StringHelper
. extract out artist name helper (instead of get(0) nonsense), or just pass as intent extra
. bundle DRY in MainActivity and ArtistTracksActivity
. DRY Fragment Callbacks
. fade music in and out

stage 2 tracks tests
- After activity and fragment finish loading, press back button. Should not crash.
- Press back button while track is playing - track should stop playing
- Press play - should start playing
- Press pause while track is playing - should pause
- Press play again after track is paused - should resume playing from previous location
- After track finishes playing, pressing play should start track from beginning
- After track finishes playing, play button should show a play icon
- Track should be able to be shared
- Press next or previous, then share - correct track should be shared
- Play a track.  Go back to track list and select a different track.  Music should stop playing
- Next / previous doesn't break with single track (search for ColdPlay Wu)
